# Instagram Bot - Made for Personal Use
## Introduction
Hi! If your reading this, you're probably taking a sneak peak of this Instagram bot, which i will be slowly adding to and trying to make more advanced when i have some spare time!

**“For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.”** 
― *Aristotle, The Nicomachean Ethics*

This has been made public so friends, family and potential employers can have a gander at some of my personal work. It is all meant to be relatively light hearted and in no way trying to attack or hack instagram (or contribute to awful bots already existing in my favourite pages comment sections).

Feel free to fork, download or do whatever you guys do :)
## Update (23/04/2020)
- bot now follows the 5 'suggested' accounts once logged in! This refreshs with each page load so there should be any issue.
- bot now likes the 3 newest pictures
- sometimes crashes on Ariana Grandes page (not a fan?)

## Update (22/04/2020)
- given up on trying to make the program comment on peoples pictures. the bot now likes everyones newest picture
